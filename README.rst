Python Types For Open Contracts and Related Applications
********************************************************

Introduction
############
These types are being used in the OpenContracts backend,
the new Gremlin Engine microservice, and a collection of related utilities
that we may release separately. Rather than maintaining these separately accross
several applications, this repo provides a convenient way to manage and deploy these
from one place.

To-Do
#####

1.  We hope to improve the documentation as standalone set of types. Currently, this is low on our list of priorities, however.
2.  We may want to deploy this to pypi so it can be installed via Pip.

Dev Tools
#########

We're using poetry for project and dependency management, though there are no dependencies.
